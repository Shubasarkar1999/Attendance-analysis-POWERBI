# Attendance-analysis-POWERBI
The aim of this project was to analyse the attendance data in Power BI and transform the data table format using the given parameters .
Transformed the actual table into both pivoted and unpivoted table and created a measure of Attendance % using DAX.

The insights are:

-2nd period has the highest attendance.

-The overall attendance percentage of the class is 62.50 %, if such level of attendance continues it may decrease the overall attendance percentage in future.

-Aarna has the highest attendance percentage (83%).

-4th period has the lowest attendance percentage of 1% , which has to be managed effectively to increase attendance.

-Atharv has lowest attendance percentage (33%).
